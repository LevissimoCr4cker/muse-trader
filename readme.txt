goal use muse S bandaim to mesure brain activity during trading btc/usd chart. and this way identify wich brain patern ( if theres any) is related to good trades. with the objective to reverse this and be able to identify the brain patern and find a good trade using only subcoscient awarness. partindo do principio que " the brain is able to identify paterns in diferent ways than the rational and logical way, one individuo that is used to suceed in stock market can develop the instinc that leads to good orders that may not have any a rational and direct indicator like the rsi or other factors , but a mix of signals that only a fast multiinterpretation ( not possible in a regular trader bot thats limited to strict laws ) . next part if found a corelation that alows to execute sucesfull trades only based in the brain signals is to be able to understand the though process and use a llm (lstm ? ) model to emulate the though process. this way creating a very efficient trader bot that is capable to analize each grapich based on training of the corelation of the brain waves and chart visual reconition. Keeping the model as simple as possible is important. Its proven that complex llm tend to underperform in simple tasks compared to simple models, because excessive information and tools can delay the decision process and are only extra noise. The objective is to develop a model that can decide wich indicator is more relevant to get a conclusion in that moment. And not using all the indicators avaliable to take one singles decision, as past results are not confirmation of future results. You can not predict trade paterns based exclusivly on the fact that one situation have happened before however this is a strong indicator that the patern may repeat and thats way simple trader bots despite of profitable tend to have high error margin, cause they work considering a patern and expect that the exact same patern will repeat again, wich can not always be true.
